# Italian Language Support - Temporarily Removed

This file contains the Italian language configuration that was temporarily removed from the LanguageSelector component.

## Italian Language Configuration:
```javascript
// Add this back to the languages array in LanguageSelector.tsx
{ code: 'it', name: 'Italiano', flag: 'ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹', path: '/it' }

// Also update the getCurrentLanguage function to include:
if (path.startsWith('/it')) return 'it';
```

## Complete Languages Array (with Italian):
```javascript
const languages: Language[] = [
  { code: 'es', name: 'EspaÃ±ol', flag: 'ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸', path: '/' },
  { code: 'en', name: 'English', flag: 'ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§', path: '/en' },
  { code: 'it', name: 'Italiano', flag: 'ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹', path: '/it' },
];
```

## Routes to Add:
When restoring Italian support, make sure to add:
- `/it` route in your main routing configuration
- Italian versions of all components (e.g., `About-it.tsx`, `Services-it.tsx`, etc.)
- Italian navbar component (`Navbar-it.tsx`)

## Instructions to Restore:
1. Uncomment the Italian language object in the `languages` array in `LanguageSelector.tsx`
2. Uncomment the Italian path check in the `getCurrentLanguage()` function
3. Create all necessary Italian component versions
4. Add the `/it` route to your main App routing
